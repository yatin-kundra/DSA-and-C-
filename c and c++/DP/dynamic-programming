Dynamic programming is an optimization technique to optimize the solution of a problem that takes a lot of time
DP can be  done by 3 methodes:
(1) top down approach:- recurssion + memoization
(2) botoum up approach:- tablulation method 
(3) space optimization 

memoization is basicaly storing the solution of the sub problems created using recurssion. so that if the the 
recursive function is called again it dosen't need to calculate for it again, it can simply look for it in a 
data structure used.


    --- to convert top down approach to botoum up approach --- 
    (1) create a dp array 
    (2) base cases 
    (3) instedad of calling the function as  a recursive function we store the ans in the dp array, using
        the perviously found solutions
    (4) return the dp array
